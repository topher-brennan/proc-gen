I created this after experimenting with existing erosion simulatiion software and being dissatisfied with features like not being able to handle connecting to off-map oceans and issues like doing erosion without deposition or not handling river deltas correctly for other reasons.

In addition to having river inflows/outflows, I experimented with having an off-map river source, but found it difficult to get sediment inflows right, and found it more effective to have an admittedly highly artificial river basin on the east end of the map.

Below reading list is mostly things I haven't incorporated but may in the future.

To run a quick (~5 minute) test:
```
cargo run --release -- --rounds 10
```

Another example usage:
```
cargo run --release -- --rounds 10000 --seed 4064140151
```
